## My process
- I started this project first by structuring my html page.
- Did my stying first by using the internal style, then I finally completed the project with the external style-sheet.
- Adjusted my html structure as I noticed that some styles weren't taking effect.
- Had a little challenge with the favicon but I eventually got the file path correctly.
- Centering my container was another big challenge for me.. but finnaly it was fixed.

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 
- CSS
- Mobile-workflow

### What I learned
- I learnt how to properly center my container. I did alot of adjustment at this point but it gave me joy at the end.
- <h3> Here is the line of code I am very excited about.</h3>

```css
.QRcode {
  height: 420px;
  width: 260px;
  margin: 40px auto;
}
```

### Continued development
- I'll like to improve more on semantic html, focus on responsiveness and using variables when styling.
- I was able to assist a track mate complete this project and I am happy I have come this far.

### Useful resources
- [Resource 1](https://www.codecademy.com/) - This helped me understand block-sizing and centering of my container.. I really liked how it was taught and  will use it going forward.
- [Resource 2](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand CSS UNIT AND VALUES. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
