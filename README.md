## My process
- I started this project first by structuring my html.
- Did my stying first by using the internal style, then I finally completed the project with the external styling.
- Adjusted my html structure as I noticed that some styles weren't taking effect.
- Had a little challenge with the favicon but I eventually got the path correctly.
- Centering my container was another big challenge for me.. but finnaly I made it happen.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 
- CSS
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learnt how to properly center my container. I did alot of adjustment at this point but it gave me joy at the end.

```css
.QRcode {
  height: 420px;
  width: 260px;
  margin: 40px auto;
}
```

### Continued development

I'll like to improve more on semantic html, focus on responsiveness and using variables when styling.

I was able to assit a track mate complete this project and I am happy I have come this far.

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://www.codecademy.com/) - This helped me understand block-sizing and centering of my container.. I really liked how it was taught and  will use it going forward.
- [Resource 2](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand CSS UNIT AND VALUES. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
